When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
* To backup your file in the remote, cloud-based repostiroy for recovery.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
* It might override changes I made locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
* Fork: Create new branch in GitHub
* Clone: Copy a branch locally
* Branch: Separate commit

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
* Should help with fast-forward merging?
