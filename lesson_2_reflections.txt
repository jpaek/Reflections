What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
* You create master repository in the directory.  Because the repository doesn't exist yet.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
* It's an intermediary between the working directory and repository.
* It allows you commit multiple files that are part of a logical unit while leaving the changes that are separate logical unit in next commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
* Add files that represent one logical change in the staging area.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
* Quickly see where each branch was branched off from the master.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
* Both branch is reachable from the point where it is merged
